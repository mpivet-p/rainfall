System-wide ASLR (kernel.randomize_va_space):
ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process,
including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and libraries.
Address space randomization hinders some types of security attacks by making it more difficult
for an attacker to predict target addresses. For example, attackers trying
to execute return-to-libc attacks must locate the code to be executed, while other attackers
trying to execute shellcode injected on the stack have to find the stack first.
In both cases, the system obscures related memory-addresses from the attackers. These values
have to be guessed, and a mistaken guess is not usually recoverable due to the application crashing.
