# When we are lauching the program it segfaults
# strace, nm and ltrace aren't working so I opened the binary with gdb


./gdb -q level0

# we can see that we only have the main and no other functions
# when reversing the main we see it takes atoi's return of argv[i] and compare the result with 423
# then it runs a shell with level1 uid

./level0 423
