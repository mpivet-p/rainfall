After reverse engineering the program, we can that we need to redirect program's
execution to n(). There is a function pointer assigned in the main, and we can
overflow the strcpy to modify the pointer before the function is called.

Using eip offset finder we find the offset is 72, so we just need to write 72
random characters and then write n()'s address in little endian.

level6@RainFall:~$ ./level6 `perl -e 'print "A"x72 . "\x54\x84\x04\x08"'`
